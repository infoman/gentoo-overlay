This is a gentoo overlay for random ebuilds I have written or downloaded that I use.

You can add this overlay using layman with the following command:

	layman -f -o http://github.com/doobry/gentoo-overlay/raw/master/layman.xml -a doobry

You should also add the url to the list of remote overlays in /etc/layman/layman.cfg
